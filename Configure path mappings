  You can customize the IIS handler mappings and virtual applications and directories. Handler mappings let you add custom script processors to handle requests for specific file extensions. 
  To add a custom handler, select NEW HANDLER. Configure the handler as follows:
  -Extension: the file extension you want to handle, such as *.php or handler.fcgi
  -Script processor: the absolute path of the script processor. Requests to file that match the file extension are processed by the script processor. Use the path D:\home\site\wwwroot to refer to your app's root directory
  -Arguments: Optional command-line arguments for the script processor
  //Each app has the default root path (/) mapped to D:\home\site\wwwroot, where the code's deployed by default. 
    // if your app root is in a different folder, or if your repository has more than one application, you can edit or add virual applications and directories
